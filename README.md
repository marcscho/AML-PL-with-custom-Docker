# Azure ML pipelines with custom Docker images

In this repository we walk through all steps required to run ML pipelines in Azure Machine Learning using a custom Docker image.

## About ML pipelines in Azure

[Azure ML pipelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-ml-pipelines) essentially allow data scientists to build, run and maintain ML workflows. In most cases, these pipelines are used to train a machine learning model from some training data. Whilst technically, ML pipelines could also be used to use data as input, apply some transformation and then output yet another dataset, other technologies such as [Azure Data Factory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/concepts-pipelines-activities) are more suitable for these kinds of pipelines.
